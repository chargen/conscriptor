  In Font Editor, a newly created or imported font must first be saved to disk 
  before downloading to BOB-4. To save it, select File--&gt;Save or File--&gt;Save 
  As. When the &#8220;Save As&#8221; dialog appears, type a file name for the 
  font file. The standard BOB-4 font file extension &#8220;.b4f&#8221; will be 
  added automatically.<br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To download a custom 
  font into a BOB-4 module, select Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Font (main port) 
  or Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Font (debug port) depending on which BOB-4 port 
  is linked to your PC. The &#8220;Select Memory Device&#8221; dialog comes up:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="ImgLoadFont1.png" width="285" height="164"></p>
<p><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Devices 0~3 are reserved 
  for supplemental font memory chips. If a supplemental device (0~3) is selected, 
  then it must be enabled and its communication rate must be configured before 
  proceeding with a download. See <strong>v</strong> command (n=56~63) in the 
  <a href="xbag.html" target="_blank">BOB-4 
  Application Guide</a>, or use the Configuration Editor.<br>
  <br>
  Standard XBOB-4 boards include an Atmel AT45DB041D (512kB) as Device 0. BOB-4 
  modules allow the customer to install Devices 0~2 as outboard options. Device 
  3 is currently unimplemented. The default setting is Device 4, which is a reserved 
  portion (62kB) of internal flash memory that is always available.<br>
  <br>
  Downloading begins as soon as a valid BOB-4 font file is selected. New fonts 
  replace all previously loaded fonts in the selected memory device.<br>
  <br>
  If only one custom font is loaded, then it's always font number 8, which can 
  be selected for use with BOB-4 command &lt;CSI&gt;8z. If more than one custom 
  font is loaded, then fonts should be selected by name instead (see <strong>z</strong> 
  command in the <a href="xbag.html" target="_blank">BOB-4 
  Application Guide</a>). This is because font numbers can change when multiple 
  fonts are loaded into different memory devices.<br>
  <br>
  </font><font size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Font names are internal 
  to font files, and <strong>not</strong> necessarily identical to font file names. 
  A font name can be changed by opening the font and selecting Edit--&gt;Font 
  Name.<br>
  <br>
  In order to load more than one font into a memory device, the desired font files 
  must first be combined into a single file that fits within the available space. 
  Space required for each font is given in the font parameter list when the font 
  is open in Font Editor. To combine fonts, select File--&gt;Concatenate Fonts. 
  When the &quot;Open File&quot; dialog appears, select all of the files you wish 
  to combine, and then click &#8220;Open.&#8221; Multiple files may be selected 
  by holding down the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key while left-clicking additional 
  file names. When the &#8220;Save As&#8221; dialog appears, name the combined 
  font file and click &#8220;Save.&#8221; Downloading the resulting file to BOB-4 
  then stores all fonts into the selected memory device.</font></p>
