<p>BOB-4 can store up to 1024 
  characters of bootscript text in a reserved segment of flash memory. Bootscripts 
  are always executed immediately after BOB-4 system initialization, before processing 
  any data received through the control ports. Bootscript Editor offers a convenient 
  way to create, edit, save, and download bootscripts to BOB-4 modules.<br>
  <br>
  Bootscript Editor saves bootscript files in plain ASCII format. This allows 
  editing with many standard text editors, but methods for entering the &lt;ESC&gt; 
  code will vary.<br>
  <br>
  To clear an existing BOB-4 bootscript, just execute a Download with the edit 
  window empty.</font>
  <br>
  When downloading a bootscript to BOB-4, Bootscript Editor automatically brackets 
  it with String Start (&lt;ESC&gt;X) and String End (&lt;ESC&gt;\) codes, and 
  then issues the Capture Bootscript (&lt;CSI&gt;8v) and Save Configuration (&lt;CSI&gt;1v) 
  commands. These commands must therefore <strong>not</strong> be included in 
  the user's bootscript. Almost any other sequence of text and commands that is 
  legal for transmission to BOB-4 through a control port is also acceptable in 
  a bootscript, but there are a couple of important exceptions:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li>Don't put the reboot 
    command in a bootscript. This is recursive, and a real show-stopper.</font></li>
  <li>Don't put &lt;CSI&gt;1v 
    (Save Configuration) in a bootscript. It will wear out the flash memory.</font></li>
</ol>
<p>In general, configuration 
  commands don't belong in bootscripts unless they are meant to be temporary. 
  It's usually best to store a new configuration instead of repeatedly issuing 
  an identical salvo of configuration commands. Users might see this issue differently, 
  especially when there's a desire to keep all of BOB-4's setup data in one block 
  of controller source code. Be especially careful of bootscript configuration 
  changes that affect screen geometry. As noted in the <a href="xbag.html" target="_blank">BOB-4 
  Application Guide</a>, the display will be cleared after an unpredictable delay 
  time. This often has the effect of immediately erasing text that was printed 
  by the bootscript.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Edit Window</strong><br>
  <br>
  Use this window to enter and edit bootscript text. To insert BOB-4 control codes, 
  see comments below.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Insert &lt;CSI&gt;</strong><br>
  <br>
  Insert the two-byte Control Sequence Introducer&nbsp;to preface BOB-4 commands 
  in the bootscript.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Insert &lt;CR/LF&gt;<br>
  </strong><br>
  Insert a Carriage Return &amp; Line Feed pair into the bootscript. This is necessary 
  to distinguish <strong>executable</strong> CR/LF codes from CR/LF used for text 
  formatting in the edit window.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>String Start</strong><br>
  <br>
  Insert a String Start control sequence, marking the start of a text string that 
  will be loaded into BOB-4's <em>String</em> buffer when the bootscript executes. 
  Some BOB-4 commands (e.g. Crawl) act on text which must be loaded into the <em>String</em> 
  buffer prior to issuing the command. Comments may be embedded in bootscripts 
  by bracketing them with String Start and String End codes, but available bootscript 
  storage space is reduced. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>String End</strong><br>
  <br>
  Insert a String End control sequence, marking the termination of a text string 
  that will be loaded into BOB-4's <em>String</em> buffer when the bootscript 
  executes.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Save</strong><br>
  <br>
  Save the currently open bootscript to a disk file (via Save As dialog).<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Load<br>
  </strong><br>
  Load an existing BOB-4 bootscript file from disk.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Download</strong><br>
  <br>
  Download the currently open bootscript to a BOB-4 module and save it in flash 
  memory, using communication parameters previously selected in the Serial menu. 
  Previous contents of the bootscript memory are destroyed. Bootscripts cannot 
  be downloaded through the debug port.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Exit</strong><br>
  <br>
  Quit the Bootscript Editor.</font></p>
