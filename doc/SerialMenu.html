<h2>Port</h2>
  <p>
    Select the host PC serial port connected to the conscriptor card.
    <br>
    Any unlisted port may be entered directly into settings.
  </p>

  <h3>Locations Where Application Settings Are Stored</h3>

  <p>
    QSettings stores settings for an application
    in up to four locations, depending on whether the settings are user-specific or system-wide
    and whether the settings are application-specific or organization-wide. For simplicity,
    we're assuming the organization is called Decade and the application is called Conscriptor.
  </p>
  <p>
    On Unix systems, if the file format is NativeFormat, the following files are used by default:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$HOME/.config/Decade/Conscriptor.conf</li>
    <li>$HOME/.config/Decade.conf</li>
    <li>/etc/xdg/Decade/Conscriptor.conf</li>
    <li>/etc/xdg/Decade.conf</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On Mac OS X versions 10.2 and 10.3, these files are used by default:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.Decade.Conscriptor.plist</li>
    <li>$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.Decade.plist</li>
    <li>/Library/Preferences/com.Decade.Conscriptor.plist</li>
    <li>/Library/Preferences/com.Decade.plist</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On Windows, NativeFormat settings are stored in the following registry paths:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Decade\Conscriptor</li>
    <li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Decade</li>
    <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Decade\Conscriptor</li>
    <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Decade</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note: On Windows, for 32-bit programs running in WOW64 mode, settings are stored in the
    following registry path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432node.
  </p>

<h2>Baud Rate</h2>
  <p>
    Select the baud rate for communication with BOB-4's main serial port. Default is
    9600 bps. This value must match the rate currently in use by BOB-4,
    unless communication is through BOB-4's debug port.
    <br><br>
    You may enter any unlisted value directly into settings.
    <br><br>
    Baud rate selection is inactive for the debug port because it's fixed by design
    to 115.2 kbps in BOB-4. In XBOB-4, the debug port is only available
    internally (not on the rear panel).
  </p>

<h2>Download</h2>

  <h3>Firmware</h3>
  <p>
    Debug or Main Port will be selected automatically
    <br><br>
    You may click the serial icon on the toolbar to confirm connectivity.
    <br><br>
    Download a valid firware file from http://www.decadeengineering.com. Status is reported on
    the status bar.
  </p>

  <h3>Font</h3>
  <p>
    Debug or Main Port will be selected automatically
    <br><br>
    You may click the serial icon on the toolbar to confirm connectivity.
    <br><br>p
  </p>

  <h3>Firmware Repair</h3>
  <p>
    Debug or Main Port will be selected automatically
    <br><br>
    You may click the serial icon on the toolbar to confirm connectivity.
    <br><br>
    This option allows the user to download 
    new firmware even if the current firmware is corrupted and nothing but BOB-4's 
    bootloader is operating. To confirm this condition, connect to either the main 
    or debug serial port at 115.2 kbps using a terminal program. At power up, the 
    BOB-4 bootloader emits: BOB4 boot loader (s: 4.1.2)
  <p>
    In the Serial menu, make sure that 
    the correct PC COM port is selected. The Baud Rate setting doesn't matter 
    in this case because BOB-4's bootloader operates only at 115.2 kbps. Select 
    Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Firmware (repair). Select the desired BOB-4 firmware 
    file (B4Vxxx.enc) in the Open File dialog when it appears. When the download 
    is complete, BOB-4 resets itself and launches the new firmware.
  </p>

<h2>Terminal</h2>
  <p>
    Opens a simple serial communication terminal emulator. 
    using the currently selected PC COM port at the current baud rate setting. 
    <br>
    Text typed into the window is line buffered (so corrections are possible) then transmitted
    when return is pressed, over the serial port, to BOB-4.
    Messages received from BOB-4 are then displayed.
