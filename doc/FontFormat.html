  <h2>

  
  <p>
  A font file for BOB-4 is used to store a collection of fonts.  Fonts are
  stored this way to allow them to be easily stored in a memory device to
  be accessed by the BOB-4 CPU, devices like SPI flash memories like the
  Atmel DataFlash.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each font is comprised of a header, an array of metrics, and a bitmap.
  If more than one font is stored in a file, they are stored sequentially,
  one after the other.
  </p>
  <p>
  All data is stored in little endian byte order.  The type names used below
  are signed or unsigned ("s" or "u") and the number of bits in the data
  type.  For example, u32 corresponds to the C data type "unsigned long".
  </p>
  <p>

  Note that each of format, metrics and pixmap must be aligned on a 32-byte
  boundary.  (Was 32-bit boundary.)
  </p>


  <h2>Format</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>
	u8 name[12]
      </td>
      <td> 
    	12 bytes of ASCII characters that comprise the name of
	the font.  The name must be terminated with a NUL ('\0')
	character.  Unused bytes should also be set to NUL.
      </td>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u32 skip
      </td>
      <td> 
	the offset from the start of this header to the start of
	the next font header, or 0 if there are no additional fonts.
	(Headers must be 32-byte aligned, so `skip' is always a
	multiple of 32).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u32 pixwidth
      </td>
      <td> 
	The number of 8-bit bytes required to make up one line of
	pixels in the font pixel bitmap (see below).  Must be a
	multiple of 4 (32-bits).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u16 chars
      </td>
      <td> 
	The number of characters in this font.  The encoding of

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u16 first
      </td>
      <td> 
	The encoding of the first character in the font.  For
	example, if the first character image in an ASCII font is
	the space character, `first' will equal 32.  Note that the
	first character image is displayed any time a character
	is displayed that does not exist in the font.

      </td>
      <td> 
	An array of character metrics (described below).  There are
	exactly `chars' + 1 entries in this array, and exactly `chars'
	times 6 + 6 bytes in the array.  The final entry in the array

  <h2>Metrics</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>
	u16 x
      </td>
      <td> 
	The distance (in pixels) from the left edge of the pixmap
	to the left edge of the character image.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	s8 left
      </td>
      <td> 
	Offset from the cursor to the left edge of the character
	image.  This is of most use for proportonal fonts.  For
	fixed width fonts, this is always 0.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u8 width
      </td>
      <td> 
	The width of this character.  Varies in proportonal fonts,
	and is fixed for fixed width fonts.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u8 top	
      </td>
      <td> 
	The first non-zero scan line
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	u8 bottom
      </td>
      <td> 
	The last non-zero scan line + 1.  For instance, for most
	characters in a 8x13 font, top = 0, bottom = 13.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
  The final entry in the metrics array has its `x' set to
  the right edge of the pixel map, and the remaining fields
  are all set to zero.  This allows the pixel width of each
  character to be calculated.
  </p>
  <p>
  When a character is rendered to the screen at the point
  XY, it is placed so that the top left of the character
  is at (X + left, Y - ascent); the next entry's `x' minus
  this entry's `x' determines the number of horizontal
  pixels to render; `width' is added to the X of XY to
  determine the position of the next character.
  </p>
  <p>
  If top = 0xff, the character is an instruction sequence
  which is executed each time the character is drawn.
  x and width must be multiples of 8 (so bytes are byte aligned).
  Bytes in the instruction sequence are read from the pixmap
  left to right, top to bottom.  The `height' of the sequence
  is the height defined in the font header format (above).
  There are necessarily a multiple of `height' bytes in the
  sequence.  The excess bytes at the end of the sequence
  are usually set to NOP.
  </p>
  <p>
  If top = 0xfe, the character is a vector sequence, which is
  rendered each time the character is drawn.  It is stored
  in the same way as an instruction sequence.  The vectors
  draw the outline of a polygon and can either fill it or
  stroke the outline.
  </p>

  <h2>Pixmap</h2>

  <p>
  u8 data[pixwidth * height]
  There are `pixwidth' times `height' bytes making up a
  single image of all characters placed left to right.
  For instance, for a font of 64 characters of 8 x 13
  pixels would be stored in an image 512 pixels width and
  13 pixels high.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each byte contains 8-bits of pixel data; the number of
  pixels in a byte depends on the value of `ldepth' above.
  Pixels are stored LSB to MSB in the byte;  bit-0 is part
  of the left most pixel and bit-7 is part of the right
  most pixel.
  </p>
  <p>
  The bytes in this image are sorted in a mixed row / column
  order (unusual for an image).  Like this (byte numbers):
  </p>
  <pre>
	   0   1   2   3       16  17  18  19
	   4   5   6   7       20  21  22  23
	   8   9  10  11       24  25  26  27
	  12  13  14  15       28  29  30  31
  </pre>
  <p>
  This ordering allows data from serial flash devices
  containing fonts to be cached by the CPU more effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
  The modified pixmap format could also be viewed as a
  collection of smaller pixmaps, each 32-bits wide and
  as high as the original pixmap.  If all of these 32-bit
  wide pixmaps were rendered horizontally, it would be
  the same as the original pixmap.
  </p>
  <p>
  Software reads 32-bytes at a time from the font's pixmap,
  and renders the appropriate slice to the screen.  As
  many slices as needed are rendered until the whole character
  is displayed.  Each 32-bytes that are read are cached
  on a recently used basis.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that each line of pixels in the pixmap must start on
  a 32-bit aligned boundary.  For instance, if `pixwidth' in
  the header were 34 bytes, 2 bytes of padding must be added
  at the end of each line, making it 36 bytes of storage.
  </p>

  <h2>Pixel Encoding</h2>

  <p>
  When using 1-bit per pixel, 0 = black (or transparent) and 1 = white.
  </p>
  <p>
  When using 2-bits per pixel, 0 = transparent (external video), 1 = half
  tone (50% external video, or grey), and 2 = white;  3 is illegal (3 will
  not cause the software to crash;  it'll just look wierd).
