customers can obtain the most recent firmware programming files by
making an explicit email request through the <a href="http://www.decadenet.com/contact/index.php" target="_blank">Contact</a> form at <a href="http://www.decadenet.com/" target="_blank">www.decadenet.com</a>.
Please review the comments on firmware upgrade issues in the
Troubleshooting section of the latest <a href="xbag.html" target="_blank">BOB-4 Application Guide</a>. Firmware
installation is possible via BOB-4's main serial port or debug port.
Use a terminal program or other means of confirming good communication
to BOB-4, and then disconnect the terminal program from the port before
proceeding!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><strong>Firmware
Upgrade Procedure</strong></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Apply
power to the BOB-4 module.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Select
the proper serial port in the Serial--&gt;Port menu.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">If
you are using the BOB-4 main serial port, then select the currently
configured BOB-4 main port baud rate from the Serial--&gt;Baud Rate
menu. Default is 9600bps. If you are using the BOB-4 debug port, then
this step is not necessary because the debug port is fixed at 115.2kbps.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Select
either Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Firmware (main port) or
Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Firmware (debug port).</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">When
the Open File dialog appears, select the firmware upgrade file.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">A
progress bar dialog will appear to show file transfer progress.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">When
the programming operation is complete, BOB-4 resets itself and launches
the new firmware.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">This
procedure may not succeed if BOB-4's firmware has become corrupted. As
long as the bootloader in BOB-4 is still operational, new firmware can
be installed by using the Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Firmware
(repair) procedure.<br>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><strong>Firmware
Repair Procedure</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">This
option allows the user to download new firmware even if the current
firmware is corrupted and nothing but BOB-4's bootloader is operating.
To confirm this condition, connect to either the main or debug serial
port at 115.2 kbps using a terminal program. At power up, the BOB-4
bootloader emits: &#8220;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">----&nbsp;BOB4
boot loader (s: 4.1.2)</font>&#8221;</font> </p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Close
the connection to the terminal program before proceeding. In the
Conscriptor Serial menu, make sure that the correct PC COM port is
selected. The Baud Rate setting doesn&#8217;t matter in this case because
BOB-4's bootloader operates only at 115.2 kbps. Select
Serial--&gt;Download--&gt;Firmware (repair). Select the desired
BOB-4 firmware file (B4Vxxx.enc) in the Open File dialog when it
appears. When the download is complete, BOB-4 resets itself and
launches the new firmware.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><strong>USB/RS232
Adapters</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">US</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B/RS-232
adapters can cause firmware upgrade
problems even if normal communications with BOB-4 have been confirmed.
It&#8217;s best to use a &#8216;real&#8217; PC RS-232 serial port (COM port) for
communicating with BOB-4. If that&#8217;s not possible, try more than one
brand of USB adapter. We&#8217;ve heard that IOGEAR makes a reliable one, and
it has been found at Wal-Mart. Decade Engineering staff hasn&#8217;t verified
this report. EasySync dual RS-232 adapters have worked well in our shop.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><strong>Notes:</strong></font></p>
Custom fonts are not affected by firmware programming sessions. The new
firmware will discover any previously installed custom fonts and make
them available for use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">BOB-4's
previous configuration settings should not be affected by firmware
upgrades, but please review the Troubleshooting section of the <a href="xbag.html" target="_blank">BOB-4 Application Guide</a> if
problems are encountered.</font></p>
